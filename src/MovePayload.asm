Payload:
.headersize PayloadDestination-orga(Payload)
; This label is intentionally at the end of the file (right after the main func), so that
; payload always refers to file offset after where MovePayload exists in SLUS_014.04,
; so that TrueOG.asm can start including other asm files right after as part of the payload.
; Then we update the header offset for where the rest of the code will exist in RAM at run time.
