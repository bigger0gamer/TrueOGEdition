PTB01:
 - Volcano was a failure, but had enough like to keep as like a hidden variant or something
 - Toto fucking ruined Revo again. Damn Dukemon and spinning the stage on purpose.
   - Either add invinc after spin + spinning punishment, or make plats unlandable
 - Glacier had mixed reception, mostly meh
 - Recycling was well liked! Thank god!
   - Try and make arm lower so it can smack rookies
 - Need more/better suggestions for custom music...
 - State visualizer & tweaked no respawn combos went without much attention, must be fine :P
 - People liked :bt: to leave stage select, as expected
 - People think basketball is neat, should work for RPS replacement in netplay just fine probably
