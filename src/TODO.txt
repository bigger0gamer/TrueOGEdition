WHATS NEW:
 - :bt: on stage/minigame select in all modes, including character preview screen in 1P arcade mode
 - Cyan flash when invincible
 - Yellow flash on stun
 - Improved Recycling, Revolution, Glacier
 - Added Basketball to 2P VS
 - Added JP 2P VS Music *in addition* to all the US Music!!!!! (Huge thank you to Nagtan!!!!!)
   - Also, there will be a bunch of custom music :D
 - Minigames all have 30 second timer
 - Change respawn combos off to increase the respawn invinciblity instead of changing respawn from launched to knockdown


PTB01:
 - Volcano was a failure, but had enough like to keep as like a hidden variant or something
 - Toto fucking ruined Revo again. Damn Dukemon and spinning the stage on purpose.
   - Either add invinc after spin + spinning punishment, or make plats unlandable
 - Glacier had mixed reception, mostly meh
 - Recycling was well liked! Thank god!
   - Try and make arm lower so it can smack rookies
 - Need more/better suggestions for custom music...
 - State visualizer & tweaked no respawn combos went without much attention, must be fine :P
 - People liked :bt: to leave stage select, as expected
 - People think basketball is neat, should work for RPS replacement in netplay just fine probably
